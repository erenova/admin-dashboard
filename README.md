# CSS Grid Practice: Admin Dashboard

This project aims to use CSS Grid mostly to create a non-functional admin dashboard. It serves as a practice ground for honing CSS skills, particularly focusing on CSS Grid layout techniques.

## Why CSS Grid?

CSS Grid is a powerful layout system available in CSS. Through this project, I'm exploring its capabilities to build complex layouts with ease and efficiency, allowing for creative design possibilities.

## Connection to The Odin Project

This project is a part of The Odin Project's curriculum, specifically designed to practice and reinforce CSS concepts and techniques. It's a reflection of the learning process and is intended purely for educational purposes.

## Overview

While the admin dashboard created in this project may look complete, it's important to note that it is non-functional and serves solely as a demonstration of CSS Grid abilities.

## Getting Started

To view the project, simply:

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser

Feel free to explore the code and see how CSS Grid is implemented in various components of the dashboard.
